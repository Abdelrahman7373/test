    In early 2006, Roblox had one currency, known as Roblox Points, which was subsequently discontinued and replaced with "Tickets" and "Robux". In mid-2007, Roblox added more customization to user characters to allow items such as hairpieces to be worn. Roblox badges were first introduced on 22 December 2006. Meshes were added, and so were the abilities of sending friend requests to other players, and sending messages. Other things accomplished in 2006 were searching through players, places, and items, multiplayer places, stats, and inventories.

        Roblox, stylized as ROBLOX, is a massively multiplayer online game created and marketed toward children and teenagers aged 8â€“18. In the game, players are able to create their own virtual world, in which they or other members may enter and socialize within the blocks of varying shapes, sizes, and colors. Games on Roblox can be scripted using a sandboxed edition of Lua 5.1, to affect events that occur in-game and create different scenarios. The company's main source of revenue comes from the "Builders Club" virtual benefits, in which users who have created an account may purchase either Builders Club, Turbo Builders Club, or Outrageous Builders Club, otherwise known by users as BC, TBC, and OBC, respectively.

        History and development
    Roblox was created by founder and co-founder David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and officially launched into its beta version, titled "Dynablocks" in 2005. It wasn't long before "Dynablocks" was renamed to ROBLOX and the website was officially launched in 2006. It was named after a portmanteau of the words robots and blocks.
    Development and Beta
    David Baszucki and Erik Cassel founded ROBLOX, then known as Dynablocks, in 2004. After a year of development, Dynablocks was renamed ROBLOX and was launched into Beta in 2005. In 2005, people could gain the cuurency at that time, Roblox Points, by completing single-player minigames developed by other users. In 2006, Roblox was officially released and more users registered.
